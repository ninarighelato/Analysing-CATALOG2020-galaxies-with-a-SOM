# Analysing-CATALOG2020-galaxies-with-a-SOM

About:
This repository contains the code and resources for analyzing galaxies from the CATALOG2020 dataset using a Self-Organizing Map (SOM). The project focuses on visualizing galaxy properties and mass distribution across redshift.

Studying the galaxy distribution as a function of time is an important step for understanding the dark matter distribution across redshift. To achieve this, we implemented a Self-Organizing Map that classifies galaxies based on their photometric bands. With this trained SOM, we can generate a redshift color-map of the galaxies, enabling us to explore their distribution in redshift-space. While the precise redshift values might remain unknown, the SOM provides a classification of how galaxy fluxes correspond to different redshift regions.

This project was developed in 2024 as part of the Institute for High Energy Physics (IFAE) Summer Fellowship Program, focusing on the intersection of cosmology and machine learning.

Requirements:
i) Python 3.8 or higher

ii) Libraries: NumPy 2.0.0, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, astropy.
